# IFS Attractor Generator

An interactive web application for exploring and generating fractals using Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and the Random Iteration Algorithm (RIA).

## Overview

This tool allows users to visualize how complex fractal structures emerge from simple affine transformations. By adjusting the position, rotation, scaling, and probability weights of transformation rectangles, you can create stunning mathematical art in real-time.

## Features

*   **Interactive Editing**: Drag and manipulate transformation maps directly on the canvas.
*   **Real-time Rendering**: See the fractal evolve as you adjust parameters.
*   **Presets**: Includes classic fractals like the Barnsley Fern, Sierpinski Gasket, Dragon Curve, and more.
*   **Customization**: Control iteration counts, opacity, and color schemes.
*   **Export/Import**: Save your custom IFS configurations to JSON.

This project was mostly vibe coded.
